Myth and Geography of Japan
The chapter begins with a mythological account of Japan’s creation. According to ancient myth, the gods Izanagi and Izanami formed the Japanese islands by dipping a jeweled spear into the ocean from the "Floating Bridge of Heaven." The drops formed the first island, and after descending to it and performing a ritual, the gods gave birth to the other main islands of Japan.

Though such myths are no longer used as explanations for Japan’s origins, they highlight a central fact: Japan is a chain of islands, which has always shaped its history and culture.

Geological Formation
Japan became an island chain about 20,000 years ago, due to natural forces breaking land away from the Asian continent. It was once connected to Korea, China, and Siberia via land bridges, but rising sea levels submerged these, isolating the islands.

Earliest Inhabitants
Previously, scholars believed humans arrived around 5000 B.C., but new archaeological evidence suggests human presence in Japan as early as 30,000 years ago. These people used stone tools—knives, scrapers, blades—and lived in simple shelters. The exact method of their migration to Japan is unclear, but land bridges were likely routes.

Jomon Culture (10,000 B.C. – 300 B.C.)
Japan’s Jomon people are known for producing the world’s oldest pottery (before 10,000 B.C.), which featured decorative rope-patterns. Archaeological evidence, such as shell mounds, shows they were hunter-gatherers who also practiced basic farming around 5000 B.C. They lived in pit dwellings, hunted deer and boar, and fished using harpoons and hooks. While their ancestry remains uncertain, they laid important cultural foundations.

Transition to Agriculture: Yayoi Culture (300 B.C. – A.D. 300)
A major shift occurred around 500 B.C., when wet-rice farming began in western Japan—likely introduced by continental migrants fleeing unrest in Korea or China. This required communal labor, leading to more permanent villages and a larger, denser population.

The new culture, named Yayoi (after a district in Tokyo), is marked by:

Simpler pottery

Metalworking (bronze and iron)

Textile production (cloth making)

Agricultural tools (e.g., wooden hoes, spades)

Bronze was often used for rituals and symbols of power (e.g., mirrors, swords, bells), while iron was practical, aiding farming and building. Some Yayoi tools resemble those still in use up to the 20th century.

Cultural Comparison and Early Social Structures
Despite these advances, the Yayoi Japanese were less developed than their Chinese counterparts, lacking a written language until around A.D. 400. Much of what is known about early Japan comes from Chinese records, like a 3rd-century Chinese history that describes:

Clothing, hairstyles, and social customs

Agriculture (rice, hemp, mulberries for silk)

Lack of certain animals (oxen, sheep, horses)

Burial practices and purification rituals

Voyages to China led by a "fortune keeper," who was revered—or executed depending on the voyage’s outcome

Emerging Social Stratification
Excavations, particularly at Yoshinogari in northern Kyushu, reveal evidence of social hierarchy and defensive structures, indicating the rise of elite classes and early forms of governance. This is a crucial step toward the political unification of Japan.

Conclusion
This chapter traces Japan’s transformation from myth and early habitation to the Yayoi agricultural society, which laid the groundwork for social organization, economic development, and eventual state formation. While still behind China in terms of sophistication, Japan was on its path toward becoming a unified and culturally rich civilization.
