Summary of Chapter Three: The Creation of a Unified State
1. Isolation and Chinese Influence:

Japan’s geographical isolation allowed it to develop a unique civilization.

However, when it needed to strengthen itself, especially in forming a centralized state, it turned to China for models—particularly in administration, writing, and religion.

2. The Nihon Shoki and Historical Record:

The Nihon Shoki, completed in 720, is Japan’s earliest official historical record, focusing on the imperial family and state-building efforts.

3. Buddhism and the Soga Clan:

In 552, Buddhism was introduced from Korea, leading to political conflict.

The Soga clan supported Buddhism and eventually defeated the traditionalist Mononobe clan in 587, marking a shift toward a bureaucratic, centralized state supported by Buddhist ideology.

4. Prince Shotoku (574–622):

A pivotal figure who promoted Buddhism and Confucian ideals.

Shotoku established court ranks based on merit, not lineage, and opened diplomatic ties with China.

He is credited with writing the "Seventeen Article Constitution," emphasizing harmony and loyalty to the emperor.

5. The Taika Reform (645):

After a coup against the Soga, Prince Nakano Oe (later Emperor Tenji) and Nakatomi Kamatari initiated reforms named Taika ("Great Change").

Key reforms included:

Nationalization of land and people.

Establishment of a centralized capital.

Land surveys, population registers, and tax reforms.

These laid the groundwork for an imperial bureaucracy with aristocrats serving as officials.

6. Taiho Code (701–702):

This legal code institutionalized the reforms and structured the state around two departments: Worship (Shinto) and State (secular administration).

Provinces were created, each governed by a noble-appointed official, while districts were administered by local aristocrats—now as imperial servants.

7. Tax and Labor System:

Peasants were allotted land (which they couldn’t own or sell), paid taxes in goods and labor, and were subject to military conscription—though military service was unpopular and led to evasion.

8. Expansion and Defense:

Japan expanded control in Kyushu and tried to subdue the Ainu in northern Honshu.

A military presence was maintained in Kyushu due to past defeats and fear of Korean or Chinese invasions.

9. Nara and the Todaiji Temple:

In 710, the capital was moved to Nara, modeled on Chinese cities.

Emperor Shomu built the massive Todaiji Temple with a huge bronze Buddha to unite the people under Buddhism and demonstrate centralized power.

Commoners participated in its construction; efforts were led by the charismatic priest Gyōgi.

10. Spread and Impact of Buddhism:

Buddhism spread to the provinces as aristocrats built temples, replacing the earlier custom of large burial mounds.

Buddhism reinforced centralized rule but also caused scandals—e.g., the affair between Empress Shotoku and the monk Dokyo, which led to fears of monks gaining too much power.

11. Conclusion:

The centralized imperial state was influenced heavily by Chinese ideas but adapted to Japan’s own context.

Though the political system later changed, the cultural impacts—especially Buddhism and administrative practices—remained deeply embedded in Japanese civilization.
