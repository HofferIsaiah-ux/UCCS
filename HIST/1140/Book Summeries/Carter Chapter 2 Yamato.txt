CHAPTER TWO: Yamato – Summary
1. Legendary vs. Historical Origins
Mythical Claim: Japanese tradition states that Emperor Jimmu, the first emperor, ascended the throne in 660 B.C. in the Yamato region.

Modern Historians’ View: This date is not historically accurate. Actual political centralization began around the late 3rd or early 4th century A.D.

The legendary date of 660 B.C. was derived using Chinese time cycles—specifically, a major cycle of 1,260 years ending in A.D. 601.

2. Early Political Unity and the Role of China
Chinese records from the 3rd century describe Japan as fragmented into over 100 small states, later reduced to around 30.

The Chinese focused on one such state led by Queen Himiko (Pimiko), a shamanistic ruler who governed with spiritual authority from her palace, likely in Yamatai.

Scholars debate Yamatai’s location: it could be in Kyushu or in the central region of Yamato, the latter aligning with later Japanese tradition and archaeology.

3. Emergence of the Yamato State
Chinese records do not confirm Yamato's dominance but archaeological evidence supports the emergence of Yamato as a center of power.

Power was extended from western Japan and even into parts of southern Korea (Mimana).

This era is marked by the construction of large burial mounds (kofun), starting small and growing massive by the 5th century.

The largest tomb, Emperor Nintoku’s kofun, covers 32 hectares and is over 800 meters long.

4. Tomb Culture and Social Hierarchy
Kofun tombs were “keyhole”-shaped and surrounded by moats. They reflect centralized labor and political power.

Over 20,000 kofun survive; the largest are found in areas under Yamato influence.

The tombs were decorated with haniwa—terracotta figures representing:

Houses, boats, animals, warriors, dancers, and shamans.

These haniwa provide insight into Yamato life and rituals, and were produced by specialized craftspeople organized into be (occupational groups).

5. Yamato Society and Government Structure
Society was structured around:

Uji: powerful kinship groups who held land and political power.

Be: hereditary occupational groups that served the uji or imperial family (e.g., rice growers, craftsmen, warriors).

Though not yet a unified nation, Yamato was more advanced than the earlier Yayoi communities in military, political, and economic control.

By the 4th–5th centuries, Yamato rulers and elite:

Adopted continental (Korean and Chinese) customs.

Became horse-riding aristocrats, buried with iron weapons, ornaments, and armor.

6. Religion and Imperial Authority
The Yamato rulers claimed descent from the sun goddess Amaterasu, giving divine legitimacy to their rule.

This spiritual role helped maintain imperial continuity for centuries, even when real power lay elsewhere.

Kami (spirits) were central to Japanese spirituality—seen in natural elements, people, and powerful forces.

The emperor was revered as a "distant kami".

7. Shinto: The Way of the Gods
Shinto (kami no michi) is an animistic, ritual-focused religion with:

No founder

No scriptures

Emphasis on purity, seasonal worship, and connection to nature

Early Shinto shrines were simple and temporary, but evolved into more complex, permanent structures.

Example: the Shrines of Ise, rebuilt every 20 years since the 7th century, house the sun goddess and show traditional Japanese aesthetics in wood and thatch.

8. External Influence and Internal Growth
Foreign artisans, often from Korea, contributed to Japan’s development through tribute exchanges.

Despite incomplete unification, Yamato rulers established a dynastic and sacred tradition that laid the foundation for future central government.

Japan would soon adopt Chinese administrative models to solidify the emperor’s control.

Conclusion
Chapter Two charts the emergence of the Yamato state, the growing power of uji leaders, and the development of a ritual-based imperial institution. Through tombs, haniwa, Shinto beliefs, and growing foreign contact, we see the transition from tribal society to a proto-state, setting the stage for Japan’s future as a centralized empire.
