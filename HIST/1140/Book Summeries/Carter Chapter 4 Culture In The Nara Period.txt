Summary of Chapter 4: Culture in the Nara Period
During the Nara Period (710–794), Japan experienced significant cultural growth, deeply influenced by continental Asia—particularly China, and to a lesser extent Korea and India. This era saw the Japanese court actively importing and adapting foreign knowledge, especially Buddhism, political theory, material culture, and literary forms.

1. Buddhist Temples and Architecture
Prince Shōtoku’s era marked the beginning of serious continental borrowing.

The Hōryūji Temple, originally built in 607 and rebuilt after a fire in 670, exemplifies foreign influence, with architectural elements from India, China, Korea, and even Greece (through techniques like entasis).

The Hōryūji became a center of Buddhist learning and preserved a foreign-inspired but distinct Japanese religious architectural style.

2. Material Culture
Emperor Shōmu and his wife Empress Kōmyō promoted Buddhism and collected cultural artifacts from across Asia.

The Shōsōin, a treasure house at Tōdaiji Temple, preserves items such as:

Ceramics, glassware, musical instruments, medicines, textiles, and ritual objects.

These items reflect influences from China, India, Persia, and Central Asia.

A standout example is a richly decorated five-string lute from India via China and Central Asia, decorated with mother-of-pearl and agate.

3. Sculpture and Art
Buddhist statues in the Hokkedō hall of Tōdaiji include complex, rule-bound religious figures and more expressive clay attendants.

Japanese sculptors quickly mastered imported techniques and produced world-class art with traces of Greco-Indian influence from Alexander the Great’s legacy.

4. Writings and Education
Scholars and monks copied and distributed Buddhist sutras, especially the Sutra of the Golden Light, which linked Buddhist support to good governance.

A Confucian-style university in Nara trained bureaucrats, though it was mainly for aristocrats.

Scholar Kibi no Makibi exemplifies success; he studied in China and led the university on his return.

5. Historical and Literary Writing
The Nihon Shoki (720) is Japan’s first full national history, written entirely in Chinese and modeled on Chinese dynastic histories but adapted to Japan’s unbroken imperial line.

Daily court life, omens, and religious activities were recorded without much analysis.

The Kaifūsō anthology collected Chinese-style poems written by Japanese aristocrats.

The Man'yōshū, a major Japanese-language poetry collection (written phonetically using Chinese characters), contains emotional, nature-filled poems by both nobles and commoners.

Key Themes
Cultural Borrowing and Adaptation: Japan enthusiastically imported foreign models but slowly adapted them to fit Japanese identity.

Religious Patronage: Buddhism served both spiritual and political roles, with emperors using it to legitimize rule.

Elite vs. Common Culture: While elites dominated education and writing, the Man’yōshū shows voices from across society.

Preservation of Culture: Structures like the Shōsōin provide rare, well-preserved evidence of 8th-century court life and international influence.
