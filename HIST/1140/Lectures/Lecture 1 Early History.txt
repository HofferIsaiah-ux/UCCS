# Early History of Japan

## I. Introduction

*   Lecture on the early history of Japan.
*   Questions are welcome at any time.
*   Japan is a group of islands on the eastern edge of the East Asian continent.
*   Japan is not a big country.

## II. Importance of Japan

*   Japan's importance stems from the Meiji Restoration and modernization (1860s onward).
*   Before the Meiji Restoration, Japan was heavily influenced by China.
*   Traditional Japan cannot be discussed without acknowledging Chinese influences (cultural, political, economic, social).

## III. Early Population of Japan

*   Homo sapiens originated in East Africa around 200,000 years ago.
*   Migration of Homo sapiens out of Africa, reaching East Asia no later than 60,000 years ago.
*   Homo sapiens likely interbred with other early humans (Denisovans, Homo erectus) in East Asia.
*   Biological traits adapted along the migration journey.

## IV. Migration to Japan

*   Around 10,000 years ago, the last Ice Age was ending.
*   Lower sea levels during the Ice Age facilitated migration.
*   Land bridge existed between present-day Korea and Japan.
*   Land bridge existed between Eurasia and North America (Bering Strait) 14,000 years ago.
*   Homo sapiens traveled to the Japanese islands via the land bridge.

## V. Periodization of Japanese History

*   Periodization is a modern invention for understanding history.
*   Periods (e.g., early Japan, medieval Japan, modern period) are arbitrary.
*   Nara period named after the capital city, Nara.

## VI. Jomon Period (11,000 BCE - 300 BCE)

*   Earliest immigrations to the Japanese islands.
*   Named after "cord-marked" pottery (Jomon means "rope imprints").
*   No written records from the Jomon people.
*   Hunter-gatherers, not farmers; likely nomads.
*   Hunted deer and fished.
*   Small population size due to reliance on local resources.
*   Ainu people of Hokkaido possibly related to the Jomon people.
*   Hokkaido not culturally/politically part of Japan until the late 19th century.

## VII. Yayoi Period (300 BCE - 300 CE)

*   New wave of immigrants from the continent.
*   Farmers; agriculture led to rapid civilization development.
*   Sedentary lifestyle (settled in villages).
*   Yayoi pottery lacked rope imprints.
*   Use of bronze utensils (bells, mirrors, seals, tools).
*   Bronze-making technology likely transmitted from the continent (China).
*   Yayoi people migrated from Eastern part of the continent, probably Korea or Manchuria
*   Named after the archaeological sites where the culture was discovered.
*   Culturally more advanced than the Jomon.
*   Yayoi colonization led to the disappearance of Jomon culture in Honshu and Shikoku.
*   Most of Japanese history took place in Honshu Island.

## VIII. Kofun Period (300 CE - 550 CE)

*   Also called the "ancient tomb period."
*   Large tombs built for powerful people, often in the shape of bronze bells.
*   Terracotta soldiers buried near tombs, possibly influenced by Chinese traditions.

## IX. Social Structure

*   Population organized by clans (uji - nobility, be - commoners).
*   Emergence of states, one of the biggest being Yamatai.
*   According to Chinese sources, Yamatai was ruled by a female queen named Himiko.
*   Himiko described as a mystical queen with supernatural power.
*   Chinese record of "dwarfs" (Japanese) visiting the Chinese Empire and paying tribute.
*   Chinese emperor appointed a Japanese king as the "king of dwarves."
*   Yamato Nation/State also mentioned by Chinese sources.
*   Yamato became the name the Japanese people gave to themselves.

## X. Missing Archeological Data

*   Most early historical details come from Chinese records, not Japanese writings.
*   The Japanese Imperial family believes they are descended from the tomb owners, restricting excavations for disturbing their ancestors' spirits.
*   DNA analysis could reveal the origins of the early Japanese population.

## XI. Religion

*   Religion resembled popular religions in Manchuria and Inner Asia.
*   Kami - the Divine, gods, and deities worshipped everywhere.
*   Shinto - the way of the Gods.
*   Polytheistic belief system (multiple gods).
*   Shrines devoted to various gods.

## XII. Early Historical Records

*   Earliest written records produced in Japan: Nihon Shoki and Kojiki (7th-8th centuries).
*   Nihon means the foundation of the sun, originating because Japan is east of the Asian continent.
*   Origin myth: Islands created by two gods (Izanami and Izanagi) who mated and created the Japanese Islands from drops from the male God's spear.
