# Continental Influence and Buddhism in Early Japan

## I. Introduction
*   This lecture discusses the Continental influence, primarily from China and Korea, and the introduction and impact of Buddhism on early Japan.
*   Building on the previous lecture about the early history of Japan, focusing on cultural and political influences.

## II. Early Japanese History According to Chinese Records
*   **Early Written Records:** The earliest written records in Japan are *Nihon Shoki* and *Kojiki* (7th-8th Century).
*   **Chinese Perspective:** Chinese sources suggest several states in Japan, with the Yamato state being the largest and eventually becoming the Japanese empire.
*   **Yamato State:**
    *   Around 300 A.D.
    *   Chinese records mention "dwarfs" coming from the Japanese islands.
    *   The Chinese emperor gave the "dwarfs" a golden seal, appointing their ruler as "King of the Dwarfs."
*   **The Golden Seal:**
    *   Discovered in Japan, now displayed in a Japanese museum.
    *   "Dwarfs" was likely a reference to the shorter average height of the Japanese compared to mainland Chinese.
    *   Attributed to nutrition, not genetics. Japanese genes are similar to Korean and Chinese people.
*   **The Milk Policy:**
    *   After the Meiji Restoration, Japan embraced Western culture.
    *   Schoolchildren were required to drink milk.
    *   Dairy consumption increased calcium intake, raising the average height of Japanese.
    *   Current average height is comparable to Chinese adults.

## III. Korean Influence and the Spread of Buddhism
*   **Korean Kingdoms:**
    *   Around 780 A.D.
    *   Three Kingdoms in Korea: Goguryeo (north), Baekje, and Silla (south).
    *   Close relations with Japan in trade, culture, and diplomacy.
*   **Buddhism's Journey:** Originated in India, flourished in China, and then transmitted to Korea and finally to Japan.
*   **Japanese Invasion of Korea (663 A.D.):**
    *   The Yamato Empire tried to establish a foothold.
    *   Japanese navy was defeated by a combined force of Chinese (Tang Dynasty) and Korean navies.
    *   This defeat prompted Japan to learn from the continent, especially the Tang Empire.

## IV. The Tang Empire's Cultural Influence
*   **Tang Empire:**
    *   Powerful empire in China, covering roughly modern-day China (excluding Tibet and parts of Central Asia).
    *   Extensive cultural influence on Japan, Korea, Northern Vietnam, and parts of Manchuria.
    *   Source of many cultural inventions adopted by Japan.
*   **Chang'an City:**
    *   The Tang capital city, a planned city with walls, neighborhoods separated by walls and gates, two markets (Eastern and Western), Buddhist temples, Christian churches, and the Imperial Palace in the north.

## V. Japanese Adoption of Tang Culture
*   **Learning from the Tang:**
    *   After the military defeat, the Japanese sent students to China to study law, Buddhism, government, architecture, culture, and the writing system.
*   **Nara City:**
    *   Ancient Japanese capital built based on Chang'an.
    *   Square or rectangle shape with horizontal and vertical streets dividing neighborhoods.
    *   Two markets (Eastern and Western), Buddhist temples, Shinto monasteries.
    *   The Imperial Palace located in the north.
    *   Nara City survived bombing during World War II, allowing the preservation of ancient structures.
*   **Fashion and Clothing:**
    *   Tang aristocratic women with elaborate hairstyles.
    *   Japanese Nara period clothing, makeup, and hairstyles were copied from Tang styles.
    *   Traditional Japanese clothing closely resembled Tang Dynasty attire.
*   **Architecture:** Japanese Buddhist temples adopted the structure and style of Chinese Tang-era Buddhist temples.

## VI. The Introduction and Spread of Buddhism in Japan
*   **Shinto vs. Buddhism:** Shinto was the indigenous religion focused on deities in natural phenomena.
*   **Buddhism's Origin and Spread:**
    *   Originated in India (around 280 A.D.).
    *   Spread via the Silk Road to China.
    *   Zen Buddhism developed in China.
    *   Spread to Vietnam, Korea, and Japan.
*   **Buddha's Life and Teachings:**
    *   Born in a kingdom in Northern India (near modern Nepal).
    *   Prophecy: He would become either a religious or a political leader.
    *   Confined to the palace until around age 30.
    *   Encountered suffering outside the palace: pain of birth, growing up, desire, sickness, old age, and death.
*   **The Four Noble Truths:**
    1.  Life is suffering.
    2.  Suffering arises from desire.
    3.  To end suffering, eliminate desire.
    4.  Follow the path to eliminate desire and escape reincarnation (Karma) to reach Nirvana (eternal happiness).
*   **Buddhist Practice:**
    *   Meditation to control the mind and body.
    *   Managing or eliminating desires.
    *   Seeking Buddhist Enlightenment and Nirvana.
*   **Sangha:**
    *   Buddhist community for those who abandon family to pursue enlightenment.
    *   Monks and nuns live in monasteries and temples.
*   **Buddhism in Japan:**
    *   Transmitted from Korea around 500 A.D., originating from China.
    *   Original Buddhist Sutras were in classical Chinese.
    *   Early Buddhist statues were imported from China, then copied by Japanese artisans.
    *   Bodhisattvas: Buddhist sages who achieved Nirvana but chose to return to help others.
    *   Guanyin Bodhisattva is a popular figure in East Asia.
*   **Great Eastern Temple (Todai-ji):**
    *   Built in Nara, Japan, as a copy of a Chinese Buddhist temple.
    *   Chinese monks, like Ganjin, traveled to Japan to spread Buddhism and Chinese culture.
    *   The opening of the temple was a major event attended by the emperor, nobles, and commoners.

## VII. Buddhism's Transformation of Japanese Society
*   **Syncretism with Shinto:**
    *   Buddhist monks integrated Buddhism with local Shinto beliefs.
    *   Stories about Buddhist deities subduing local deities were created to promote Buddhism.
*   **Buddhist Temples as Landholders:**
    *   Emperors, aristocrats, and commoners donated land and wealth to Buddhist monasteries.
    *   Monasteries hired samurai for protection, creating "Buddhist Samurai."
*   **Power Struggles:**
    *   Conflicts within the royal court between those supporting and opposing Buddhism.
    *   Buddhism eventually gained dominance with imperial support.

## VIII. Prince Shotoku and the Centralization of Power
*   **Prince Shotoku:**
    *   Regent and actual leader of Japan in the early 7th century.
    *   Modeled Japan after China, using the title "Tenno" (Heavenly Emperor).
    *   Centralized power away from feudal lords.
*   **Policies to Transform Japan:**
    *   Supporting Buddhism as the state religion.
    *   Promoting vegetarianism (although fish was not considered meat).
    *   Sending students to China for education.
    *   Implementing reforms to mirror the Chinese system.
*   **Shotoku's Legacy:**
    *   Appears on the 10,000 Japanese Yen bill.
*   **Different Buddhist Branches:** Many branches, transmitted to Japan from China (Zen Buddhism, Esoteric Buddhism, Pure Land Buddhism).

## IX. The Taika Reform (646 A.D.)
*   **Purpose:** To create a centralized empire in Japan like China.
*   **Significance:** A turning point in Japanese history, comparable to the Meiji Restoration.
*   **Policies:**
    1.  **Centralized Political Power:** Feudal lands divided into "koku" (administrative units like prefectures). A bureaucracy was built, moving away from feudalism.
    2.  **Nationalization of Land:** All land was declared to belong to the state (Emperor). Slaves were freed (though only on paper). Land was redistributed to registered households to work.
    3.  **Salaries for Aristocrats:** Aristocrats received salaries from the state after giving up their land.
    4.  **Standardized Taxation:** Taxes paid in goods to the central government, and labor service to the central government was also required.
*   **Failure of the Taika Reform:**
    *   Japan reverted to feudalism centuries later due to geographical factors.
    *   Japan's mountainous terrain and island geography made it difficult for the central government to control local lords.

## X. Conclusion
*   The Continental influences, particularly from China, greatly impacted early Japan through the adoption of Buddhism, government systems, culture, and architecture.
*   The Taika Reform, although ultimately unsuccessful in creating a lasting centralized empire, marked a significant attempt to transform Japan into a system similar to China's.
