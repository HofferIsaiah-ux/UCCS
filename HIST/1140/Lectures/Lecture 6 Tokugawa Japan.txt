## Political Structure of Tokugawa Japan

*   **Two Sources of Authority:**
    *   **Shogun (Bakufu in Edo/Tokyo):** Held military power.
    *   **Emperor (in Kyoto):** Held legitimacy as a living god.
*   **Checks and Balances:** Shogun and Emperor provided checks and balances.
*   **Limited Imperial Power:** Emperor was a figurehead, lacking taxation or military power.
*   **Shogun's Attempts at Legitimacy:** Built shrines to his family, cultivating a cult of personality (largely unsuccessful).

## Bakufu Policies to Control Daimyo

*   **Challenge:** Controlling the *daimyo* (major feudal lords).
*   **Daimyo Classification:**
    *   *Fudai daimyo* (close daimyo): Trusted, given land near Edo.
    *   *Tozama daimyo* (far away daimyo): Less trusted, given land far from Edo. (e.g., Satsuma, Choshu in the south).
*   **Land Reallocation:** Tokugawa reallocated land as rewards to loyal followers.
*   **Oath of Loyalty:** Daimyo swore loyalty.
*   **Castle Restrictions:** Each daimyo was limited to one castle.
*   **Alliance Prohibition:** Alliances between daimyo were forbidden.
*   **Limited Fiscal Control:** Bakufu lacked direct taxation power. Local daimyo had fiscal autonomy.

## Alternate Attendance System (Sankin-kotai)

*   **Policy:** Daimyo had to live in Edo for one year and then in their home base for another year. Family (often a son) resided in Edo as a hostage.
*   **Purpose:** Control the daimyo, preventing rebellion.
*   **Economic Consequences:** Boosted markets and economy along highways connecting Edo and other domains.
    *   Osaka developed as a major market town.
    *   Merchants' cultural difference (vs samurai).

## Edo: A Growing Metropolis

*   **Edo's Growth:** Became one of the largest cities in the world (population of one million).
*   **Population Size:** Japan's population reached approximately 33 million by the 1800s (compared to 5 million in Britain).

## Limits to Growth

*   **Natural Resource Shortage:** Japan lacked natural resources, limiting growth (a major factor in World War II).
*   **Sakoku (Closed Country) Policy:** From 1635 to 1853, bakufu implemented a closed country policy, limiting foreign contact.
    *   Christianity was banned.
    *   Overseas travel was restricted.
    *   Foreign trades were heavily regulated (except with the Dutch).
*   **Limited Trade:** Trade with China was only allowed through the uq Kingdom (Okinawa) and Korea (tsushima).
*   **Globalization Isolation:** Japan intentionally cut itself off from globalization.

## Social Structure and Ideology

*   **Social Class System:** Based on Confucian ideology.
    *   Samurai (top)
    *   Farmers
    *   Artisans

*   **Okinawa:** During the topograph period, Okinawa was a independent Kingdom called it YouTube. Influenced by China culturally due to being a protectorate.

## Social Problems

    *   Introduction of new crops (potato, sweet potato) increased food production.
    *   Population grew, but wealth remained stagnant, leading to lower GDP per capita.
*   **Social Instability:** Despite the lack of major warfare, social unrest and conflicts existed.

## The 47 Ronin (Loyal Retainers)

*   **Story of the 47 Ronin:** A famous story highlighting conflicting moral codes.
*   **Meeting:** Shogun held a meeting to welcome the emperor's representative, heated debate between two daimyo, one daimyo used his fan to knock on the head of the other daimyo. Insult to the daimyo to be knocked so he took out his sword, but was stopped. Shogun was in fault and committed sepaku.
*   **Unfair Ruling:** His land and castle were given to the daimyo with the fan.
*   **Revenge:** Forty-seven of the daimyo's samurai refused to disband and sought revenge on the daimy who got hit in the head with a fan.
*   **Plot:** Stormed the other daimyo's residence and killed him.
*   **Loyalty:** Loyal to their master, even willing to break the law.
*   **Surrender:** The Ronin gave themselves in to the bakufu and committed suicide.
*   **Public Perception:** Considered heroes by ordinary Japanese people.
*   **Significance:** Demonstrates the conflict between local moral standards and government laws, private loyalty versus national loyalty.

*   **Challenged System:** The older social cancer system is being challenged as merchants rose in power and sumurai were challenged to find new jobs.
