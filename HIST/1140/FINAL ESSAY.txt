FINAL ESSAY
Thesis: Throughout Japan's history, Japan has used the idea of other nations to grow as a country

	Thesis AI: Throughout its history, Japan has harnessed its perception of foreign nations as a catalyst for internal 		transformation and national growth.


Support 1: Chinese Influence in Early Japan
Japan’s Asuka and Nara periods saw the purposeful adoption of Chinese political, religious, and cultural systems. Through missions to the Tang court and study of Confucian ideals, Japan implemented central governance models, a legal code (ritsuryō), and Buddhism as a unifying ideology. This wasn’t blind imitation—it was a strategic move to strengthen internal cohesion and legitimize imperial authority.

Support 2: Adoption of Firearms from Europe
The arrival of Portuguese traders in 1543 introduced firearms to Japan. Within decades, the Japanese not only adopted but improved upon these weapons, integrating them into their military strategy—culminating in landmark battles like Nagashino (1575). The willingness to abandon traditional samurai combat in favor of foreign technology showcases Japan’s flexible and pragmatic mindset when foreign tools offered practical power.

Support 3: Meiji-Era Westernization and Rapid Modernization
Facing colonial threat and inspired by Western models of industrial and military power, Meiji leaders overhauled Japan’s systems. They sent students abroad, studied European legal codes, and hired Western experts to modernize everything from railroads to education. The goal wasn’t dependence but transformation—positioning Japan as a sovereign, industrialized power among Western empires.

MIDTERM: 
Thesis: Japan’s strategic adaptation of foreign cultural influences—particularly in religion, law, and governance—was crucial to the formation of its early state, but it also led to increasingly rigid ideological control that suppressed religious freedom.

Support 1: Shinto and Hierarchical Legitimacy
In early Japan, native Shinto beliefs were used to establish a sacred hierarchy. Powerful clans (uji) claimed descent from kami (spirits or gods), legitimizing their rule through divine ancestry. The imperial family, in particular, asserted direct lineage from the sun goddess Amaterasu, merging spiritual authority with political power and laying the groundwork for a theocratic leadership model.

Support 2: Chinese Legal and Religious Models (Tang Dynasty Influence)
During the 7th and 8th centuries, Japan imported Chinese political and legal frameworks, notably the ritsuryō system. Alongside Confucian administrative ideals, Buddhism—also from China—was adopted by the state to support order and moral discipline. This fusion of law and religion created a centralized government but limited religious pluralism, as Buddhism became entwined with state authority.

Support 3: Christianity and the Closure of Japan
In the 16th century, European missionaries introduced Christianity, which gained traction among some daimyō and commoners. However, Tokugawa leaders viewed it as a threat to political stability and cultural unity. In response, they banned Christianity, persecuted converts, and enacted the sakoku policy in the 1630s to severely restrict European influence. This policy effectively suppressed alternative belief systems in favor of a tightly controlled religious landscape.
