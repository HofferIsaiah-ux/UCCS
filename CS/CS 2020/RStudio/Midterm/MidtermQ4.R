#Midterm Question 4: Sampling Theory 

# Law Of Large Numbers
# As the amount of data increases, the average result will begin to head towards 
# the expected output and this way of sampling is called, The Law Of Large Numbers.
# This law is important becasue as more data is collected the test will get closer
# to the true result and allows us to gane more reliable results as the test goes on.
# It allows tests to be reliable, and acuralte. 

# Central Limit Theorem
# According to the Central Limit Theorem, the sampling distribution of the mean will 
# become normal no matter what the distribution looks like. This means that the mean 
# of every sample will create a bell-shaped normal distribution.
