#Midterm Question 2: Descriptive Statistics

#Making Array
X = c(9, 15, 12, 20, 17, 10, 16)

# Getting Mean of X
mean(X, na.rm = TRUE)

# Getting Median Of X
median(X, na.rm = TRUE)

# Getting Interquartile Range Of X
IQR(X, na.rm = TRUE)

# Is the Standard Deviation Low Or High? 
# The standard deviation would be fairly low because with the mean being around 14
# and the median being 15 would indicate that the data points are somewhat symmetrical
# and with the IQR also being low causes a low standard deviation because these values 
# indicate a closer cluster of values
